            Welcome to all students,I wish heartiest congratulations to you for joining Glocal University.As you are a member of this prestigious University, you are expected to be a sensible and disciplined student. 
            “Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.” -Jim Rohn
            As the Chief Proctor of The Glocal University, it is my duty and the duty of all members of Proctorial Board to maintain discipline and decorum in the University Campus, but it cannot be achieved without your cooperation and coordination. Discipline plays an important role in the life of an individual person and group of persons. It is the path to a successful life and key to freedom from rigidity of thought and bad perspective of life.
            “For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.” – Plato
            We practice discipline in all the domains and expect the same from the students.The Glocal University encourages all the students to take part in the academics as well as extracurricular activities of the University. You are expected to spend quality time with your friends, interact with teachers, go to library and equip yourself with knowledge, maintaining the decorum and discipline within university campus.You may find some kind of restrictions in University Campus. Those restrictions are not shackles in the legs of the students rather they teach them how to be in limits, what to do and what not to do, and how to do anything. And that is discipline. This discipline that you are going to practice in University life will become your habit, and habits play significant role in giving shape to the future. The discipline gives wings to fly in sky of dreams.I and each member of Proctorial Board wish all the students a very bright future.</a></div>
