    <h1>The Campus – An Environment for Holistic Learning</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="box1">
        <div id="content">
            <a>The amazing transformation of a child blossoming into youth, from school to college, Glocal believes in nurturing a holistic education, which is about honing every facet of a student, helping an individual develop life-skills, a spirit of enquiry to explore the unknown, attitude of life-long learning, so that she acquires knowledge and not just information. Beyond learning in the classroom and laboratories, Glocal has developed a mechanism to introduce each student to a wide range of co-curricular activities. We strive to take care of the oft-quoted gap by industry about students who are fresh from college: ‘that they are unemployable!’ The reason for this is simple: students are not ‘industry-ready’, because they lack two essential attributes: personality and soft skills.
    
                The curriculum of Glocal has been designed in such a way that students get to develop these two qualities and more, by encouraging team work, inter-personal relationships and a kind of camaraderie—cutting across their study subjects, ethnic, regional and economic backgrounds. We celebrate diversity by encouraging students of diverse backgrounds to mingle with each other in hostels, sports and other co-curricular events.
                
                To facilitate such activities on the campus and build up an environment of nurturing the talent in the students, we have development the campus with facilities and amenities which could help students to get involved in on co-curriculum activities also after their studies.</a>

    <h1>Halls of Residence</h1>
    <div class="box1">
        <div id="content">
        <a>The university is equipped with fully furnished separate hostel facilities for boys and girls. The hostels are specially designed with two primary objectives of safety and comfort. It has round-the-clock security, with stringent security procedures and comfortable apartments that our students enjoy living in. The hostels have state-of-the-art washrooms (toilet and bathing cells). Cleanliness is maintained by the staff on duty. Each hostel room provides an amiable atmosphere and pollution-free environment, conducive to the mental, physical and spiritual development of the students and helps them become self-reliant.

        Each Hostel (separate for boys and girls ) in the university is self-contained with amenities such as a reading room, an indoor games room, a lounge and a dining hall with mess.
    
        The deliberations of the Hostel are governed by the Hostel Committees which includes student representatives under the office of Chief Warden. Working through this responsible body, the committee members lay down appropriate norms of behavior to suit different situations and social occasions in the hostels including the norms for dining hall.</a>

        <div id="content">
            <a>Glocal University is nestled in the foothills of Shivalik range, and well connected by roads from three major cities. In the north, it is connected with Paonta Sahib (HP) which is further linked to Jagadhri and Chandigarh by roads; towards north it is connected to Saharanpur (UP) which has a major railway station while towards the east it is connected to Dehradun (UK), the state capital of Uttarakhand. Glocal University provides transport facility to its day scholars on nominal charges through its self- owned comfortable buses. The buses ply on different routes of the Saharanpur to pick and drop the students from various areas. The students are spared the difficulty of commuting to the University by public transport. This also contributes to inculcating an element of punctuality among the students. Keeping in mind the fact that University is situated in a remote place away from modern amenities,the university provides bus facility to every weakened to its students and staff to visit Dehradun, Saharanpur or Ponta Sahib.</a>
